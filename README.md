# MPO-S: PROPERTY

## Definition

A **Property** within the **Meta-System Ontology (MPO-S)** is a fundamental invariant, manifesting as a stable relation between entities within a specific **Contextual Ontological Regime (ChOR)**. It is not an attribute or a predicate, but represents a *mode of reality’s organization*, generating observable regularities — phenomena interpreted as “laws.”

---

## Formal Definition

A **Property** is an *atopological invariant* within the structure of **Superreality** that ensures the preservation of a specific type of relation through system transformations. It does not arise as a pre-established given, but as a result of **actualization** (the process of transition from indeterminacy to determinacy) during interaction between entities.

## Key Aspects

1. **Ontological Status**  
   Properties do not “belong” to objects nor are they imposed externally. They manifest in the act of interaction, remaining *potential* until the moment of actualization.

2. **Phenomenological Source**  
   Properties are discerned as *invariant relations* that persist across various ontological regimes.

3. **Relation to Laws**  
   Laws are secondary descriptions of patterns formed by properties.  
   **Exemplars**:  
   - The law of gravitation does not precede the properties of mass and spacetime — it is their *epiphenomenon*.  
   - Juridical laws do not create social relations — they formalize pre-existing invariants of power, justice, and contract.

4. **Role of Actualization (Γ-operator)**  
   Actualization is the process whereby a *potential property* acquires a concrete form within a given context. This is not “creation,” but the *distillation of an invariant* from a manifold of possibilities via interaction.

5. **Universality and Specificity**  
   Properties are *universal* in their invariance (`KSS → ∞`) yet *specific* in their mode of manifestation within each ChOR (`ChOR → ∞`).

## Synthesis

A **Property** in MPO-S is a *rule for assembling an ontological layer*. It is **non-hierarchical**, but possesses:  
- **Intensity** (a degree of stability)  
- **Capacity** (the ability to interact with other properties)

> **Laws are not the foundation of reality** — they are its *formalized aspects*, conditioned by properties through their actualization in specific contexts.  
> Thus, MPO-S shifts focus from seeking “laws” to unveiling *invariant properties* that generate these laws as observable consequents.

## P.S.

This definition does not reduce a property to something simpler — it positions **Property** as a *primary concept at the core of ontology*, requiring the full power of the **MPO-S axiomatic framework** for its description.
