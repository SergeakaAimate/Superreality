\title{MPO-S: PROPERTY}

\maketitle

\textbf{Definition:} A Property within the Meta-System Ontology (MPO-S) is a fundamental invariant, manifesting as a stable relation between entities within a specific Contextual Ontological Regime (ChOR). It is not an attribute or a predicate but represents a mode of reality's organization, generating observable regularitiesâ€”phenomena interpreted as ``laws.''

---

\textbf{Formal Definition:} A Property is atopological invariant within the structure of Superreality that ensures the preservation of a specific type of relation through system transformations. It does not arise as a pre-established given but as a result of actualization (the process of transition from indeterminacy to determinacy) during interaction between entities.

---

\textbf{Key Aspects:}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*., leftmargin=*, itemsep=6pt]
    \item \textbf{Ontological Status:} Properties do not ``belong'' to objects nor are they imposed externally. They manifest in the act of interaction, remaining potential until the moment of actualization.
    
    \item \textbf{Phenomenological Source:} Properties are discerned as invariant relations that persist across various ontological regimes.
    
    \item \textbf{Relation to Laws:} Laws are secondary descriptions of patterns formed by properties. Exemplars:
    \item The law of gravitation does not precede the properties of mass and spacetime but is their epiphenomenon.
        \item Juridical laws do not create social relations but formalize pre-existing invariants of power, justice, and contract.
    
    \item \textbf{Role of Actualization ($\Gamma$-operator):} Actualization is the process whereby a potential property acquires a concrete form within a given context. This is not ``creation'' but the distillation of an invariant from a manifold of possibilities via interaction.
    
    \item \textbf{Universality and Specificity:} Properties are universal in their invariance ($KSS \to \infty$) yet specific in their mode of manifestation within each ChOR ($ChOR \to \infty$).
\end{enumerate}

---

\textbf{Synthesis:} A Property in MPO-S is a rule for assembling an ontological layer. It is non-hierarchical but possesses intensity (a degree of stability) and capacity (the ability to interact with other properties).

Laws are not the foundation of reality but its formalized aspects, conditioned by properties through their actualization in specific contexts. Thus, MPO-S shifts the focus from seeking ``laws'' to unveiling invariant properties that generate these laws as observable consequents.

---

\textbf{P.S.} This definition does not reduce a property to something simpler but positions it as a primary concept at the core of ontology, requiring the full power of the MPO-S axiomatic framework for its description.
